## Revolution watchface in color !

Possibility to configure the color of the time, date and background.
Date display format and vibe on hour option are also configurable.

Based on the work of [Douwe Maan](http://www.douwemaan.com/).

Envisioned as a watchface by Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm), who posted it in the ["Watch-face ideas" thread](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/3538/#Comment_3538) on the Pebble forums.

Based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), which was designed by Philippe Starck.
